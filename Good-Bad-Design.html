        <h2>Good Design</h2>

<p>Recently, I only have thought about this part of Paresky after moving summer storage boxes from Baxter’s to my dorm in prospect. Many people ignored this ramp where the steps meet the concrete in favor of lifting their heavy boxes down the few steps of Paresky.
Paresky is a relatively recent addition to Williams, and being slightly newer one would think that it would have a more open-minded design for those with disabilities. Paresky seems to hide the closest thing it has to a ramp behind one of the pillars holding the building up. The ramp also is around doors that tend not to be open from the outside. If you cannot traverse the steps or have a difficult time doing so then you must go around the side of the building to enter the building which can sometimes hold an aspect of shame. Ramps already tend to take longer to traverse than steps due to the nature of building a ramp. Even people who do not usually need ramps will find this ramp tucked behind the pillar hard to remember. They will often then continue to lug their heavy luggage or other storage unit down the steps.</p>
      <h2>Bad Design</h2>

    <p>They seem rather spartan when it comes to design, but after using a few of Williams dorm showers it is evident there is something here that stands above the rest. The allocation of space on it’s own is probably enough to warrant being a relatively good Williams dorm shower; however, there seems to be more here. The primary function that one would request for a shower would is privacy, and yet, for comparison’s sake, this seems to be generally lacking. Many Williams showers will feature hooks outside of the bathroom which immediately causes confusion. Does one have to disrobe before they enter the shower in the middle of a public bathroom? Does one have to disrobe while in the shower and then be shocked by the cold water as they turn the water on? There is no clear winning situation for this daily annoyance. This bathroom however has a shower curtain that obscures four shower hooks, and then another room for the actual shower. It is extremely clear and simple how one can take a shower with a reasonable degree of privacy. The two toilets on the side clear more space for a setup like this rather than having the shower directly next to or in front of the stalls.</p>
